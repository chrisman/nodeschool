I'm going to be working through the cores and electives on [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io/)

Dots next to a section track pomodoros spent on that topic.

## Core

* [x] Javascripting ..
* [x] How to npm ..
* [x] learnyounode ...... Holy crap my brain
* [x] Scope Chains & Closures Short and sweet
* [x] git-it. not much new here. except the practice of adding an upstream remote
* [ ] ~~stream-adventure~~ <-- I think I broke an npm package, and now all the tests are failing. I'll have to come back to this one.
